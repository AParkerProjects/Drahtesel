This morning I had a bratwrust for breakfast.
Then I decided to drive to Berlin for the day.
My hund bit me in the biergarten.
Then, I ran over Rammstein on the Hauptstrasse.
Had to replace my Porsche with a new BMW.
Drove to play wettbewerbsfaehig hockey at the Schloss.
<<<<<<< HEAD
My dirndl got dirty because tripped onto a doener stand, so I changed into my lederhose. 
Then I went to the Flughafen and booked a flight to Raesfeld.
